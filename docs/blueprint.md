## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light teal (#A7DBD8), evokes a sense of tranquility, freshness, and health, fitting for a healthcare application.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8F5F4), provides a clean and calm backdrop, ensuring readability and reducing eye strain.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#BCA0DC), complements the primary teal by adding a touch of sophistication.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif which is suitable for headlines or body text, so it can be used for both.
- Use simple, clear, and professional icons, maintaining consistency throughout the interface.  The style of icons should not be too bold or eye-catching.
- Implement a responsive, split-screen layout with clear content sections for form input and calendar display.
- Use subtle loading animations and smooth transitions for a polished user experience.
